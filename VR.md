# Introduction to VR

### Introduction

Virtual Reality (VR), it involves creating a simulated environment either based on the real world or entirely fictional using computer technology. It provides an user an immersive experience, through engaging multiple senses such as sight, hearing, touch (more likely the ability to sense the simulated environment through the feels), allowing users to feel as if they are truly part of that environment.

While,as for Augmented Reality (AR), it works by improving the existing real-world environment experience by overlaying digital layers to the real-world environment. For example, Snapchat has a feature where people can add digital filters or effects to their surroundings that is possible because of AR. 



## Difference between AR and VR
Although AR and VR may seem and sound like they are similar at first glance,but they are fundamentally different technologies. AR enhances the real-world environment by adding digital layers, while VR creates a fully digital environment, completely replacing the real world with a simulated experience.

- VR provides a fully enclosed, synthetic experience, completely immersing the user in a digital environment with no view of the real world. In contrast, AR keeps the real world central to the experience, enhancing it with virtual elements rather than replacing it.

- AR experiences are often accessed through online platforms or mobile applications,hence making them easier to access. VR experiences, on the other hand, usually require installed software or dedicated hardware to run, making them less immediately accessible.

 
## Trends in Virtual Reality

The trends in Virtual Reality (VR) technology shows the growing interest and ongoing development, particularly in creating more immersive learning platforms and experiences. Key areas of development in VR include:

**Immersive Digital Spaces** :  VR aims to create environments that feel completely real. High-fidelity scene rendering techniques such as real-time ray tracing, texture mapping, and dynamic shadow effectsâ€”help replicate real-world visual characteristics.

**Multimodal Sensory Feedback**: VR aims at improving the integration of multiple senses to improve immersion:

*Visual Perception*: High-resolution textures and real-time object feedback enhance spatial perception.

*Auditory Perception*: Accurate sound direction and dynamic audio improve realism.

*Olfactory Perception*: Though less common, research explores using synchronized scent cues to deepen sensory immersion.



Future research in VR technology is focused on overcoming current limitations,which includes:

**Hardware Improvements**: The present VR headsets are bulky and have a problem of overheating and very costly, Hence developing lightweight, cost-effective VR hardware to address issues such as weight, heat, battery life, and high costs.

Content Scalability: Another area of development would be creating more VR content that is adaptable, modular, and reusable to support diverse applications efficiently.


## Companies in VR Space


With the growing interest in VR, many companies are actively developing and innovating in this field such as Meta, Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Unity etc.

**Meta** : Meta acquired Oculus in 2014,and released its first VR headset in 2016, making it the year of VR and they are focused on establishing a strong presence in VR gaming.

**Apple**: Apple introduced it's VR headset in the name of the Apple Vision Pro, enabling it's users to connect and interact with mobile apps, videos, and other content directly through the headset in any environment.

**AppliedVR**: A healthcare focused company with over 30 years of expertise in the VR space. It provides immersive therapeutic experiences to help patients manage their chronic pain and improve overall well-being.

**Framestore**: This company creates VR experiences of theme parks and has designed specialized headsets for National Geographic.

**Immersive Touch**: Focused on healthcare, Immersive Touch converts 2D medical images into 3D spatial models to enhance surgical planning and training.


These companies shows how diverse the applications of VR can be, from gaming and entertainment to professional training and healthcare,highlighting the growing role of VR technology across industries.
